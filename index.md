<p align="justify"> I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.bates.edu/economics/">Bates College</a>. I received my PhD from the Department of Economics at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/economics/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. <br><br>

My research interests lie in the areas of macrofinance and the economics of gender. <br><br>

I have a masters degree in Economics from <a href="https://www.jnu.ac.in/">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> and a bachelors degree (with honors) in Economics from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/view_department.php?deptid=66">Jadavpur University</a> in India. <br><br>

<strong>My research in a nutshell:</strong> <br>
My current research can be divided into two streams. The first analyzes the heterogeneous effects of economic and policy shocks on bank lending behavior. The second stream of my research studies the gendered effects of macroeconomic policies. <br><br>

I was part of an interdisciplinary team funded by an NSF Growing Convergence Research (GCR) grant to study the sustainability of open source software. A few of my current projects build on this collaboration.
