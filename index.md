<p align="justify"> I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at <a href="https://www.bates.edu/economics/">Bates College</a>. I received my PhD from the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/economics/">Department of Economics</a> at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. <br><br>

My research interests lie in the areas of Macroeconomics, International Finance, and the Economics of Gender. <br><br>

I have a masters degree in Economics from <a href="https://www.jnu.ac.in/">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> and a bachelors degree (with honors) in Economics from <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/view_department.php?deptid=66">Jadavpur University</a> in India. <br><br>

<strong>My research in a nutshell:</strong> <br>
My current research can be divided into two main streams. The first looks at the gendered effects of macroeconomic policies. My <a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/the-impact-of-austerity-on-gender-inequality-in-time-allocation-in-the-united-states/">job market paper</a> investigates whether cutbacks in public spending during the Great Recession impacted men and women differently. <br><br>

The second stream of my research analyzes the connections between bank ownership and lending behavior. I have two ongoing projects that study various aspects of bank lending decisions. <br><br>

I was part of an interdisciplinary team funded by an NSF Growing Convergence Research (GCR) grant to study the sustainability of open source software. A few of my current projects build on this ongoing collaboration.
