<p align="justify"> I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.umass.edu/economics/) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I will be on the job market during the 2022-2023 academic year.

My research interests lie in the areas of Macroeconomics, International Finance, and the Economics of Gender.

I have a masters degree in Economics from [Jawaharlal Nehru University](https://www.jnu.ac.in/) and a bachelors degree (with honors) in Economics
from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/view_department.php?deptid=66) in India.

**My research in a nutshell:** <br>
My current research can be divided into two main streams. The first looks at the impact of macroeconomic policies on gender equality. My [job market paper]({{ site.url }}/assets/The%20Impact%20of%20Austerity%20on%20Gender%20Inequality%20in%20Time%20Allocation%20in%20the%20United%20States.pdf) investigates whether cutbacks in public spending impact men and women differently.

The second stream of my research analyzes the connections between bank ownership and lending behavior. I have two ongoing joint projects that study various aspects of bank lending decisions.

I am also part of an interdisciplinary team that is examining the social, technical, and institutional factors that contribute to the sustainability of open-source software. Currently, I am collaborating on two projects that look at how incubator programs influence the governance of open-source software projects. </p>
