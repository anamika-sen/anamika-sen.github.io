The Impact of Austerity on Gender Inequality in Time Allocation in the United States <br>

**Summary:** <p align="justify"> The Great Recession of 2007-2009 caused large declines in state revenues which prompted many states to implement austerity measures to meet their balanced budget requirements. Decreases in public spending can have heterogeneous gender effects due to existing inequalities in time allocated for unpaid work. In this paper, I combine data from the American Time Use Survey for 2005-2015 and the State and Local Expenditures database to investigate the relationship between decreases in state education spending and time spent on child care. My analysis compares changes in time allocated for child care activities by adults residing in states with and without spending reductions on K-12 and early education programs. I find that prior to the decreases in education spending, time spent on child care activities across austerity states and non-austerity states trended similarly. However, in the years following the spending cuts, residents of austerity states were spending more time on child care relative to residents of non-austerity states. The increase in child care in austerity states was unevenly distributed across genders – men were allocating 1.8 hours more weekly while women were allocating 3 hours more weekly to child care. The effect of austerity measures on the gender gap in child care time persists even six years after the initial reduction in education spending, thus having long-lasting implications for progress towards gender equality. My findings suggest the need for gender budgeting at all stages of the fiscal budget cycle which can allow governments to pursue both economic and social goals even during times of crisis. </p>
